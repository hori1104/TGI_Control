# Temperature Control for TGI
This is a tutorial for temperature control of Peltier elements for Thermal Grill Illusion intensity control

# Features
In thermal grill illusion (TGI) generation using warm and cold stimuli, continuous cooling of the cold stimulus enables the control of perceived pain intensity. 
This tutorial will guide you through the temperature control methods for Peltier elements to achieve TGI intensity control and briefly discuss its application to VR environments 

 
# Requirement
Peltier elements × 6

Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

The following circuits for temperature measurement circuits for the Peltier elements (× 6)

# Usage
By using Experiment1.py, the Peltier elements used for cold stimulation can be continuously cooled from 25°C to 20°C over a specified duration. Among the six Peltier elements,
two are maintained at a constant 41°C, while the other four are initially held at a constant 25°C before commencing cooling to 20°C. 
In the code, X, Y, Z, L, M, and N distinguish the six Peltier elements, which are arranged as shown in the figure below.
